## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
npm install ng-mlpm
# or
pnpm add ng-mlpm
# or
yarn add ng-mlpm
```

### Basic Usage

```typescript
// Import the component in your standalone component or NgModule
import { MlpmComponent } from 'ng-mlpm';

@Component({
  // ...
  imports: [MlpmComponent],
  // ...
})
export class YourComponent {
  menuItems = [
    {
      label: 'Dashboard',
      icon: 'dashboard',
      link: '/dashboard'
    },
    {
      label: 'Settings',
      icon: 'settings',
      children: [
        { label: 'Profile', icon: 'person', link: '/settings/profile' },
        { label: 'Preferences', icon: 'tune', link: '/settings/preferences' }
      ]
    }
  ];
  
  onMenuItemClick(item) {
    console.log('Menu item clicked:', item);
  }
}
```

```html
<ng-mlpm 
  [title]="'My App'" 
  [titleIcon]="'menu'" 
  [menuItems]="menuItems"
  [colorTheme]="customTheme"
  (linkClick)="onMenuItemClick($event)">
</ng-mlpm>
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Development

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Angular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:

```bash
ng generate component component-name
```

For a complete list of available schematics (such as `components`, `directives`, or `pipes`), run:

```bash
ng generate --help
```

## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

## Running unit tests

To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

## Running end-to-end tests

For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.
